People are working 9-5, hunched over desks and keyboards all day, and the situation is not very different for students, which make up about 15% of Turkey’s population according to a recent research.\nThe third one is that, interestingly enough, diabetes has seen a new high in 2022 and not 2019. There might be several reasons for that, and to make educated guesses we can put forward the lack of movement in our daily lives that got only worse after the Covid-19 pandemic. Or the fact that no one has time to consume ‘good’ food anymore. We don’t cook our own meals as often, instead opting for takeout after an exhausting shift that sucked the life out of us. Even if we do cook, we no longer can guarantee that our ingredients don’t contain a plethora of chemicals that we can’t even pronounce the names of.\n\n\n\n\n1.3 Distribution of Percentage by Gender for Each Disease\n\n\nShow the code\nabbreviate_disease_names &lt;- abbreviate(data_1_longer$Diseases)\nbox_13 &lt;- plot_ly(data_1_longer,\n              x = ~reorder(abbreviate_disease_names, -Percentage),\n              y = ~Percentage,\n              color = ~Gender,\n              colors = c(\"#1E7DFF\", \"#FC90FF\"),\n              type = \"box\") %&gt;% \n  layout(boxmode = \"group\",\n         title = \"Distribution of Percentage by Gender for Each Disease\",\n         xaxis = list(title = \"Diseases\",\n                      zeroline = FALSE),\n         yaxis = list(title = \"Percentage\",\n                      zeroline = FALSE))\nbox_13",

The decrease in the “doesn’t consume” category seems to be more steep- Can it be the decline in the purchasing power with most recent economic disasters? Or is it the simple fact that people are choosing healthier lifestyles?\n\n\n\n2.3 Percentage of Consumers of Alcohol Use by Sex and Age Group\n\n\nShow the code\nconsumers_data &lt;- data_2_longer %&gt;%\n  filter(usage == \"Consumers\")\nconsumers_data$year &lt;- factor(consumers_data$year, levels = c(2016, 2019, 2020, 2022))\nchart_23 &lt;- ggplotly(ggplot(consumers_data, aes(x = year, y = age, fill = rate)) +\n  geom_tile() +\n  facet_grid(cols = vars(gender), scales = \"free\") +\n  labs(title = \"Percentage of Consumers of Alcohol Use by Sex and Age Group\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Age Group\",\n       fill = \"Percentage\") +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"white\", high = \"#fc8d62\") +\n  theme_minimal())\n\nchart_23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe age range for alcohol consumers seem to overlap for both men and women- We can see from this visual representation that both men and women around the ages 25-34 consume more alcohol than any other age range.

The lack of movement and healthy food intake that we talked about earlier are definitely big contributors. But let’s approach this one from a different perspective: The tabooing of fatness and eating disorders in our society. Beauty standards. Our inclination to not believe people even when they voice their struggles. One thing that’s very common in especially younger people is using food as a form of escapism. What we need is to restore our relationship with our food consumption, and to start treating our bodies with respect and love. Much of physical health is closely connected with that of the mind.",

To achieve this, we gather data and evaluations from students who have previously completed their internships at these companies. The information in our database allows students to know what they can expect to experience and what to expect within the opportunities provided by these companies. In addition to evaluations, our database also includes information about the application process for internship programs offered by relevant companies.\n\n\n\n1.2 Application Features\n\n\nCompany Search: Users can search for companies offering internships based on various criteria such as location, industry, duration, and specific requirements.\nStudent Evaluation System: A platform where students can provide feedback and evaluations on their internship experiences, including ratings for different aspects such as work environment, mentor-ship, learning opportunities, and overall satisfaction.\nCompany Profiles: Detailed profiles for each company, including information about their internship programs, requirements, past interns’ experiences, and any additional benefits offered.\nInternship Opportunities: A section dedicated to listing current internship opportunities available at different companies, with details on application websites, requirements, and how to apply.\nAnalytics and Insights: Data analytics features to provide insights and trends based on the evaluations and feedback collected from students, helping to identify top-rated companies, popular internship programs, and areas for improvement.\n\n\n\n\n1.3 Relations (Tables) and Their Attributes as an Initial Design\n\nStudent\n\nstudent_id (Primary Key)\nfirst_name\nlast_name\nemail\njoin_year\ngpa\n\nCompany\n\ncompany_id (Primary Key)\ncompany_name\nindustry\nlocation\ncontact_info\nwebsite\n\nInternship\n\ninternship_id (Primary Key)\nstudent_id (Foreign Key)\ncompany_id (Foreign Key)\nintern_type\ndepartment\nyear\nstart_date\nend_date\nduration\nincome\nworking_hours\ntransportation_status\n\nRating\n\nrating_id (Primary Key)\ninternship_id (Foreign Key)\ntransportation_rating\nwork_env_rating\nlearning_opp_rating\nfood_rating\nhr_rating\nmentor_rating\ncomment\n\n\n\n\n1.4 Relationships\n\n\ninternships belongs to company: One-to-many relationship, each company can offer multiple internships, but each internship is associated with only one company.\ninternship belongs to student: One-to-many relationship, one student can have multiple internships, but each internship is associated with only one student.\nrating belongs to internship: One-to-one relationship, each internship has one rating, and each rating is associated with only one internship.\nstudent to rating through internship: One-to-many relationship, each student can have many ratings as well as internships, but each rating can only have one student and one internship.\ncompany to rating through internship: One to many relationship, each company can have many ratings as well as internships, but each rating can only have one company and one internship.",

It helps compare health internationally and gives insights into what health needs a country has for its development.\n\nData source: Türkiye Health Survey 2022\n\n1.1 Why We Selected This Data\n\nWe picked the ‘Türkiye Health Survey’ data set for our EMU430 course because it’s interesting and fits well with what we’re learning. This data set gives us a lot of information about health in Turkey. We can study things like how people take care of their health, how much alcohol they drink, what common diseases there are, and the body mass index of individuals. It’s a good choice for our course because it covers a lot of important health topics in Turkey.\n\n\n\n1.2 Our Objectives\n\nOur main goal is to study how people’s health changes with age and differs between men and women. We want to understand how behaviors and diseases vary based on these factors. By doing this research, we hope to gather useful information that can be used to create better health policies and strategies.\nOur plan is to use numbers and graphs to look for patterns and differences in the data. We believe that showing our findings visually will make them easier to understand. But before we start, we need to make sure the information we have is correct and complete. We’ll check and fix any mistakes or missing details to ensure that our results can be trusted. Following this plan, we aim to make our project’s goals, the data we’re using, and how we’re studying it clear. This will set a strong foundation for our project to move forward successfully.",

If you already have an idea, please check past issues to see whether your idea or a similar one was previously discussed.\nBefore submitting a pull request, consider implementing a live example first, say using bl.ocks.org. Real-world use cases go a long way to demonstrating the usefulness of a proposed feature. The more complex a feature’s implementation, the more usefulness it should provide. Share your demo using the #d3js tag on Twitter or by sending it to the d3-js Google group.\nIf your proposed feature does not involve changing core functionality, consider submitting it instead as a D3 plugin. New core features should be for general use, whereas plugins are suitable for more specialized use cases. When in doubt, it’s easier to start with a plugin before “graduating” to core.\nTo contribute new documentation or add examples to the gallery, just edit the Wiki!\n\n\n\nClick the “Fork” button to create your personal fork of the D3 repository.\nAfter cloning your fork of the D3 repository in the terminal, run npm install to install D3’s dependencies.\nCreate a new branch for your new feature. For example: git checkout -b my-awesome-feature. A dedicated branch for your pull request means you can develop multiple features at the same time, and ensures that your pull request is stable even if you later decide to develop an unrelated feature.\nThe d3.js and d3.min.js files are built from source files in the src directory. Do not edit d3.js directly. Instead, edit the source files, and then run make to build the generated files.\nUse make test to run tests and verify your changes. If you are adding a new feature, you should add new tests!
