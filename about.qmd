The **Team Data Ciphers** story began in the fall of **2023** during the **Data Analytics** course led by the inspiring **Erdi Da≈üdemir** and it was there that a group of people interested in data met and began working together. They have continued to work together ever since.

The **Team Data Ciphers** have grown and evolved since then, welcoming new members who share their passion for data analysis. *Now, even stronger and more diverse*, they continue their exciting journey of discovery, ever eager to crack the codes and unlock the power of information.

We are a team with a strong interest in exploring the potential of data. We see ourselves as data detectives, working hard to uncover the stories and insights data can reveal. Through a careful process of analysis and interpretation, we aim to transform raw information into meaningful outcomes.

***We would also like to express our sincere appreciation to Erdi Dasdemir, whose inspiration ignited our collective passion for data exploration.***
