## EMU Hacettepe Internship Informing & Feedback System {toc-text="Our Database"}

### Objective

::: {style="text-align: justify;"}
Our database aims to facilitate the process of selecting and finding companies for internships for students of Industrial Engineering at Hacettepe University. To achieve this, we gather data and evaluations from students who have previously completed their internships at these companies. The information in our database allows students to know what they can expect to experience and what to expect within the opportunities provided by these companies. In addition to evaluations, our database also includes information about the application process for internship programs offered by relevant companies.
